Project Description
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes. In this project, we analyze the performance of several machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, for breast cancer detection.

We start by preprocessing and exploring the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which provides measurements of various features extracted from breast mass samples. Then, we train and test each algorithm using the dataset and evaluate their accuracies individually. Finally, we employ XGBoost, an ensemble method, to combine the predictions of all four models and create a new model that is expected to achieve higher accuracy than the individual models alone.
