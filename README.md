# Analysis of Breast Cancer Detection using Ensemble Method

This project aims to analyze and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer detection using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The project also explores the use of an ensemble method, XGBoost, to combine the individual models and improve the accuracy of breast cancer detection.

## Project Description

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes. In this project, we analyze the performance of several machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, for breast cancer detection.

We start by preprocessing and exploring the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which provides measurements of various features extracted from breast mass samples. Then, we train and test each algorithm using the dataset and evaluate their accuracies individually. Finally, we employ XGBoost, an ensemble method, to combine the predictions of all four models and create a new model that is expected to achieve higher accuracy than the individual models alone.

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and reproduce the analysis.
5. You can modify the notebook and experiment with different parameters or algorithms if desired.

## Results

The project provides insights into the performance of different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer detection. It compares the accuracies of KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes algorithms individually. Furthermore, it showcases the effectiveness of the ensemble method, XGBoost, in combining the models and improving accuracy.

The results obtained from running the project code can be found within the Jupyter Notebook itself. The notebook contains detailed explanations, visualizations, and evaluation metrics for each algorithm, as well as the performance of the ensemble model.
